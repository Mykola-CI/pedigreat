# Pedigreat
Pedigreat is a fictional brand name, which occurred to me when I was contemplating on the project. Googling this brandname gives no exact matches save one in Nigeria that is related to construction development. \
In this project Pedigreat is an imaginary small-scale business solution in canine and pet-sitting service sector. It teams up experienced dog-lovers who have turned their passion for dogs into a career. Pedigreat develops a net of local house owners willing to provide a second-home boarding for Pedigreat clients. The business is based in Berkshire, UK, known for its exceptional walking paths, pet-dedicated playgrounds and amazing meadows. 
In contrast to the existing Uber-like large nets of amature pet-sitters or big companies blanketing vast territories, Pedigreat position themselves as serving Berkshire communities only. Pedigreat challenges to exercise individual approach policy equipped with in-depth knowledge of local landscapes, resources and lifestyles.
