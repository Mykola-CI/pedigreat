# Pedigreat
Pedigreat is a fictional brand name, which occurred to me when I was contemplating on the project. Googling this brandname gives no exact matches save one in Nigeria that is related to construction development. 
In this project Pedigreat is an imaginary small-scale business solution in pet-care and pet-sitting service sector. It unites experienced dog-lovers who have turned their passion for dogs into a career. Pedigreat fictional pet-sitters and trainers also maintain a chain of local house owners willing to provide a second-home boarding for Pedigreat clients. The business is based in Berkshire, UK, known for its exceptional walking paths, pet-dedicated pitches and amazing meadows.
