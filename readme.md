# Pedigreat
Pedigreat is a fictional brand name, which occurred to me when I was contemplating on the project. Googling this brandname gives no exact matches save one in Nigeria that is related to construction development. 

In this project the Pedigreat is an imaginary small-scale business solution in canine and pet-sitting service sector. It teams up experienced dog-lovers who have turned their passion for dogs into a career.    
In order to facilitate boarding part of the business the Pedigreat develops a net of local house owners willing to provide a second-home boarding for Pedigreat clients. The business is based in Berkshire, UK, known for its exceptional walking paths, pet-dedicated playgrounds and amazing meadows. 

In contrast to the existing Uber-like large nets of amateur pet-sitters or big companies blanketing vast territories, Pedigreat position themselves as serving Berkshire communities only, targeting local pet owners. Pedigreat challenges to exercise individual approach policy equipped with in-depth knowledge of local landscapes, resources and lifestyles. Pedigreat personnel stress that they don't sell hours, they rather sell emotions and passion for their furry clientele. 

To facilitate the main business objectives the Pedigreat team has launched a front-end web-site as a first stage of its further development.   
The site can be accessed at the following link  [Pedigreat Web-Site](https://mykola-ci.github.io/pedigreat/index.html)

### Comments On User Stories
Technically the web-site is supposed to employ html & css tools only at the first stage of its development. The business model is adjusted to provide its functionality without undertaking complex back-end software that would manage the automation of scheduling, booking, billing, chatbot etc. That is why the business model and eventually its web-site assumes, at least for now, human-to-human contacts only when making appointments and booking services.

Yet the registration form will appear on one of the pages because Pedigreat offers promotions and cross-promotions, as well as email newsletters for the registered clients. Many of users' wants can be met in the newsletter communication and a relevant event marketing.
