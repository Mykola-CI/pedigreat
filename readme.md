# Pedigreat
Pedigreat is a fictional brand name, which occurred to me when I was contemplating on the project. Googling this brandname gives no exact matches save one in Nigeria that is related to construction development. 

In this project Pedigreat is an imaginary small-scale business solution in canine and pet-sitting service sector. It teams up experienced dog-lovers who have turned their passion for dogs into a career. \ 
In order to facilitate boarding part of the business Pedigreat develops a net of local house owners willing to provide a second-home boarding for Pedigreat clients. The business is based in Berkshire, UK, known for its exceptional walking paths, pet-dedicated playgrounds and amazing meadows. 

In contrast to the existing Uber-like large nets of amature pet-sitters or big companies blanketing vast territories, Pedigreat position themselves as serving Berkshire communities only, targeting local pet owners. \ Pedigreat challenges to exercise individual approach policy equipped with in-depth knowledge of local landscapes, resources and lifestyles. Pedigreat personnel stress that they dont sell hours, they rather sell emotions and passion for their furry clientelle.

The global template structure for all pages is a header, main content and a footer.

The first user's hit will be the landing page and the banner. It is equipped with a main title
