            <h3>About Our Team</h3>
            <div class="about-us--information">
                <p>Welcome to our world of pet companionship! We are a team of dedicated dog lovers, committed to
                    providing exceptional care for your furry family members. Our services range from dog boarding and
                    sitting, to training, walking, and offering professional advice on all aspects of dog keeping and
                    breeding.
                    Our team is made up of experienced professionals who have turned their passion for dogs into a
                    career. We understand that your dogs are more than just pets - they are part of your family. That's
                    why we treat every dog in our care as if they were our own, providing them with the love, attention,
                    and care they deserve.</p>
                <p>We believe that every dog is unique, with their own personality, needs, and quirks. That's why we
                    tailor our services to suit each individual dog, ensuring they receive the care and attention they
                    need to thrive. Whether your dog needs a comfortable place to stay while you're away, a friendly
                    companion to keep them company, or a skilled trainer to teach them new skills, we are here to help
                </p>

            <div class="testimonials--text1">"I can't recommend this pet sitting service highly enough! When we had to
                leave town unexpectedly, they took in our Labrador, Max, and treated him like one of their own. The team
                was professional, caring, and kept us updated with photos and messages. When we returned, Max was happy
                and well-cared for. It's clear that this team doesn't just provide a service, they genuinely love and
                understand animals. We won't hesitate to use their services again in the future."</div>

            <div class="testimonials--text2">"As a first-time pet owner, I was nervous about leaving my kitten, Daisy,
                alone while I was at work. But this pet sitting service has been a godsend. They not only ensure Daisy
                is fed and entertained, but they also offer invaluable advice on her care and behavior. I've noticed a
                significant improvement in Daisy's behavior and overall well-being. The team is reliable, knowledgeable,
                and clearly passionate about what they do. I'm so grateful for their help and highly recommend their
                services to any pet owner."</div>
